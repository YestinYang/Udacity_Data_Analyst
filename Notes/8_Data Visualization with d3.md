# Data Visualization with d3.js

## Data Visualization

> Data visualization is interactively exploring data, instead of infographics intented to show a predefined fact by data.  [Reference](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2014/03/infographics-to-reveal-visualizations.html) 
>
> Your greatest insight is only as good as your ability to communicate it.
>
> > Not only accuracy, think about how someone might use your model or derive some value from your analysis.

**PS:** EDA is for the understanding between you and data, while data visualization is for your audience.

#### Ranking of Visualization Techniques

> Ranked by how accurate when people decoding varied plot elements

1. Position along a common scale e.g. [scatter plot](http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/2468)
2. Position on identical but nonaligned scales e.g. [multiple scatter plots](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pas/19/1/images/pas_19_1_88_fig7a.gif)
3. Length e.g. [bar chart](http://flowingdata.com/2009/07/02/whos-going-to-win-nathans-hot-dog-eating-contest/)
4. Angle & Slope (tie) e.g. [pie chart](http://flowingdata.com/2008/06/09/what-do-you-use-to-analyze-andor-visualize-data-poll-results/)
5. Area e.g. [bubbles](http://flowingdata.com/2007/10/02/americans-prefer-watered-down-beer/)
6. Volume, density, and color saturation (tie) e.g. [heatmap](http://flowingdata.com/2010/01/21/how-to-make-a-heatmap-a-quick-and-easy-solution/)
7. Color hue e.g. [newsmap](http://newsmap.jp/)
